1)  bipartite graph : each vertex should belong to the one of the two sets and vertices should connect to different set nodes
    odd cycled can't be bipartiti but even numbered cycle may or may not be bipartite
    
2)  cycle detectaion in directed  https://youtu.be/XmCHHSiXARc
    cycle detectaion in undirected  https://youtu.be/eCG3T1m7rFY
 
3)  in conected components we can calculate number of nodes via incrementing a size var in dfs calls in main function
